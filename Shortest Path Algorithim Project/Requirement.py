 ''' CS 3364 Algorithms: Project 3
Finding the shortest path to go to other buildings from Computer Science building 
Acquirement:
Both Greedy and Dynamic programming are basic strategies of algorithm design. In this project, 
you are asked to implement, and test a greedy algorithm (Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm) and a dynamic 
programming algorithm (Bellman Ford). Graphs are broadly used in modeling real world 
applications. You can use the prototype of the abstract data type (ADT) graph developed in 
previous project and further extend it. '''
