''' In the real life, we have many things to do. We always need to think of the sequence to get things done: which we need to do first, which we can do next. This is a topological ordering problem. For example, in order to finish our program, we also need to think about the sequence of taking the courses, since some courses have their prerequisites. The following is the courses required by an undergraduate program in our computer science department. Could you find the solution for you and your fellows?

Computer Science Major (prerequisites in the bracket)
CS 1411 - Programming Principles I (N/A)

MATH 3342 - Mathematical Statistics for Engineers and Scientists (MATH 2450)
POLS 2306 - Texas Politics and Topics (N/A)
CS 3365 - Software Engineering I (CS 2365, CS2413 and MATH 3342)

CS 4354 - Concepts of Database Systems (CS 3364)
CS 4366 - Senior Capstone Project (CS 4365)

Acquirement:
Graphs are broadly used in modeling real world applications. In this project, you are asked to design, implement, and test an abstract data type (ADT) graph in its prototype. It can include frequently used algorithms, such as DFS, BFS, and so on. In this project, you are required to implement the topological ordering algorithm only, which is based on DFS. Other algorithms can be extended in the future. In order to output the sequence of the courses, you need a sorting algorithm, which will put the courses in the order according to their post visiting numbers.
